# Bikeshare
### Overview of the statistical analysis 
##### The analysis examined the use of the citibike program within New York City. We looked at frequency of use across gender, times of day, and neighborhood. Our goal was to better understand the citibike data and be potentially able to apply the information to bike share programs in other locations.
### Results 
##### We examined the use of citibikes in august specifically, as it is one of the warmest months in the north east, it supplied ample amounts of data from bike usage. We found the the time of day that most people use the bikes was during rush hour. See below:

##### We found that gender does not impact the time of day that bikes are used:

##### That being said, we did find that more men than women tend to use the bikes. More data would be needed to understand why this might be the case, some factors could include safety as well as required work attire for women being more physically limiting and therefore making it harder to bike to and from work.

##### The data makes clear that the areas with the highest rate of use for the bikes is Manhattan. This part of the city tends to be the hardest part of the city to navigate with a car. The bikes are used in the other burrows as well, but not at the same frequency. More data is needed to understand why. It could be about population density, wealth inequality or length of commute for the average person living in the other burrows compared to those in Manhattan.

##### Most trip durations are under an hour

### Summary
##### It is clear that the citibike share program in New York is highly successful, and that the program may work in other parts of the country. More data is needed in order to understand how the program can be best implemented in other parts of the nation. Some useful visualizations may be understanding how wealth by neighborhood impacts the use of the bikes, as well as looking at the use of the bikes during less warm months, and how weather might impact the gender breakdown of bike usage.
